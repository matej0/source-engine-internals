3 internal cheats for tf2, dod and csgo all based on darkstorm. Some stuff pasted.
There is a minhook folder in each of the cheats. This is due to me just merging all 3 projects prior to release into one repository. Originally I wanted to release only the TF2 cheat but since the other 2 are almost the same just with minor changes, I said fuck it.
